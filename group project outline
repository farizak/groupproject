Fari-> i guess theres a chat aspect to this c9 thing but
I dont know how to use it. I have gmail and slack.
Stephen emailed me but I thought we could all just comment
on this random text page and read as we go instead
of constantly checking gmail.

Karim, Stephen volunteered to do the html, is that ok?
I think were all suppose to contribute so thats why we 
can manipulate the code. We can work on the CSS/Content.
Please add to the pages. And we can check the project
checklist Cira gave us as we go.

I like this website but with way less tabs and info:
